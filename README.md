Hunt
====

Solve a lights out puzzle using the hunging technique.

This can solve the game lights out quickly for you, but now with boards with a height of 1.

Please excuse my coding style, I made this for fun, and I'm not really experienced. This code has no memory bugs.

Hunt will first ask you for width and height of the board.
Then you can switch individual lights on the board on or off.
Next, it will solve your board for you, or print an empty board if no solution has been found.

To build, just run Make.
