Hunt
====

Hunt down all burning lights except for the bottom row.

This can analyze the game lights out quickly for you. Right now it can only use the hunting technique to turn off all lights except for the bottom row.
Please excuse my coding style, I did not have much time to write this.

Maybe I will add features like dumping the output to a file, or automatically building up a database of results.

To build, just run Make.
